# Learn Python and OpenCV through Hands-On Projects

This repository serves as a resource for IAAC students and faculty to enhance their skills in **Python** and **OpenCV** through practical projects. The goal is to build real-world applications while reinforcing fundamental concepts of programming and image processing.

## üìÇ Projects in the Repository

### 1. üñºÔ∏è Mondrian Analyzer

The **Mondrian Analyzer** is a Python-based tool designed to analyze images inspired by the art of Piet Mondrian. It leverages the power of **OpenCV** to detect and analyze primary colors in an image, calculate pixel coverage, and visualize detected regions.

#### **Key Features:**
- Load images in PNG or JPG format.
- Detect and analyze primary colors: red, blue, yellow, black, and white.
- Calculate pixel count for each detected color.
- Identify contours and visualize detected areas.
- Save results in an Excel file (color_analysis.xlsx).
- Interactive user experience with options to save or restart analysis.

#### **Usage Instructions:**
1. Run the script using:

   ```bash
   python mondrian_analyzer.py
   
2. Enter the path to the Mondrian-style image when prompted:

   ```bash
   Enter the path to the Mondrian image (PNG/JPG): mondrian1.png
   
3. The program will process the image, calculate areas, and show visual output.
4. Example output:

   ```bash
   Yellow: 5230 px, 8 contours
   Blue: 4320 px, 5 contours
   Red: 6700 px, 10 contours
   
5. The processed image will be displayed and saved as processed_mondrian1.png.




### 2.Material Cost Estimator

The **Material Cost Estimator** is a simple Python-based tool that helps estimate construction costs by calculating the total cost of materials required for a project.

#### **Key Features:**

- Input room dimensions (length and width).
- Choose from available materials such as wood, concrete, brick, and tiles, with associated costs per square foot.
- Automatic calculation of total material cost.
- Option to save the estimate to an Excel file for future reference.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Instructions

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed before running the scripts:
	pip install opencv-python numpy pandas matplotlib openpyxl
	
#### **Usage Instructions:**
1. Run the script using:

   ```bash
   python python_building_material_cost_estimator.py

	
2. Enter the required details when prompted:
	```bash
	Enter the length of the room (in feet): 20
	Enter the width of the room (in feet): 15
	hoose a material:
	1. Wood ($8/sq ft)
	2. Concrete ($12/sq ft)
	3. Brick ($10/sq ft)
	4. Tiles ($5/sq ft)

	Enter your choice (1/2/3/4): 2

3.  The tool will calculate and display the total cost:

	```bash
	The total cost for the selected material is: $3600.00

4. Choose whether to save the results:

	```bash
	Do you want to save this estimate to a file? (yes/no): yes
	Project saved successfully!
